# Rockbuster Data Analysis Project Using SQL

## Project Background
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, formerly a global chain of 
movie rental stores, is planning to launch an online 
video rental service. In response to intense 
competition from streaming services like Netflix and 
Amazon Prime, the management aims to leverage its 
existing movie licenses to remain competitive in the 
market.

## Key Questions
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions theyâ€™d like to answer:

* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Technology Used
Rockbuster's data was held in a Relational Database Management System. Data included information about past rentals and purchases, customer information, film information, and more. PostgreSQL was used with pgAdmin4 to analyze the data. Tableau Public was used for data visualizations. Google Sheets was used for the final presentation.
